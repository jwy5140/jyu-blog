Hi there, I'm Jeff. Looks like you found your way onto my personal website! Welcome!

To introduce myself - I originally graduated university with a Bachelor's degrees in Engineering and Russian, but am currently pursuing Software Engineering.

There are so many possibilities to create, improve, and help through the applications that we build - and these bring us a sense of fulfillment.

However, in order to achieve creation, improvement, and to succeed in helping others - we need to learn first!

So I've devoted myself to the journey of lifelong learning, and hope that I also discover along the way.

This blog serves as a tool to share what I encounter on that journey.
